# Udacity_More_SQL

This repository contains notes of the various chapters from Udacity's SQL course.  In Lesson 1, SQL basics were introduced for working with a single table as well as key commands for filtering tables in many different ways.  Lesson 2 shows how to combine data from multiple tables using Joins.  Lesson 3 students were taught how to aggregate data using SQL functions.  Lesson 4 focused on subqueries, a fundamental advanced SQL topic.  The lesson walked through the appropriate applications of subqueries, and the different types of subqueries.  Data Cleaning using SQL was discussed in Lesson 5.  SQL Window Functions were the explained in Lesson 6.  In this lesson, window functions were used to compare one row to another without the use of Joins.  Lesson 7 discussed advanced Joins and edge cases, some of which come up in interviews.
